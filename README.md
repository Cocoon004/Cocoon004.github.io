The cocoon vol.04 is the fourth in a series of installations of the same name by artist Ana Maria Suso. After multiple attempts at bridging architecture and craft in the pursuit of redefining ways of making, this iteration is a leap from the individual into the collective, touching on the theme of connection: across identities, across scenes, across senses.

Through the medium of crochet, oftentimes burdened with the perception of the feminine, the domestic, and the docile, this installation demands a new narrative in which crafts can be as rough as they are frilly, as disruptive as they are comforting, and as abstract as they are concrete. It is an ode to the subversive. 

The accompanying soundscape created by sound artist Lilla Belso layers sounds into a composition that blurs the line between the organic and the synthetic. Interlacing recordings of the crochet making process with soft melodies forged on a synthetizer, this sound piece helds a safe place for the ones in need for a quiet moment with the self.



The space youâ€™re about to enter is the fruit of a collaborative effort to reconceive spaces of equal parts connection and disconnection; an amalgam of unusual counterparts. In the spirit of this manifesto, you are invited to intervene on the piece, leaving your trace in the web. For this purpose there are some materials inside for you to create with, but you are also welcome to use anything else - a (mis)placed object, an amulet, a thought, a love letter. 
As long as there is respect, all is allowed. 


This installation has been made in collaboration with Knits and Notes as part of Amsterdam Dance Event.
